    	     RequireJS know which file it should load. This file (scripts/main-built.js)
    	     can be seen as the entry point (main) of the application.

             It is worth noting that here we include the "built"/optimized version of our
             main file (which is main.js). This results in all dependencies being analyzed
             and included in the "main-built.js" file, which means that not extra requests
             to load other modules are made. -->
